AWS Artifact  -> It contains security and compliance report
AWS Secret Manager  -> Used for authentication, not for encryption

I/O throughput == instance store

fanout is only supported for kinesis.

DynamoDB On-Demand capacity allocation  -> For Unpredictable workload
ByDefault DynamoDB Adaptive Capacity is turned on.
Resource based policy is not supported for DynamoDB, ElasticCache, DAX.

when we change the data using write-through ElasticCache cluster, it is immidiatelty reflected (Fastest)

API Gateway can connect to one or more services to refactor the architecture.
API Gateway has limit 10k requests/sec

Gateway Endpoint -> Works with S3 & DynamoDB. (It is Free)

On-Demand instance -> For uninterrupted solution

AWS Snowball -> Does not use internet to move the data

AWS DataSync -> To automate & accelerate the replication of data to AWS storage service

DynamoDB, ElasticCache, RDS -> Sutable for storing session state data

Way of configuring custom NAT instance -> Source/Destination check should be disabled on NAT instance

You can have one Elastic IP (EIP) address associated with a running instance at no charge.

How to create AMI while running instance -> Yes, if only "no reboot" option is checked

UDP protocol is not used while using Route

Use EC2 private IP for replication

Dedicated instance is Most-Cost effective for isolation
